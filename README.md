# ToDo

This is a project designed to help with time management. As many apps are out there, I've found that none of them have the unique set of functionality I want out of my time management solution, so I decided to make one myself. It's a work-in-progress, but the plan is to eventually implement a few unique features, including
* A heirarchical category planner, into which items and tasks can be sorted
* A full history of changes to your ToDo list in order to facilitate...
* Extensive data analysis related to things like self-imposed deadlines, task completion rate, and time spent on different categories
  * This will allow tracking of improvement on meta-goals, such as determining how much time you want to spend doing certain things so that a healthy balance between pusuing your goals and enjoying your free time can be achieved
